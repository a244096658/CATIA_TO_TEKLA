# CATIA_TO_TEKLA

The console application developed for converting CATIA model to TEKLA model. So far it can convert a single I-Shape beam to TEKLA and can be parametrical. 

Next step: Figure out how to use "Graphic model capture" and how to unzip the 3DXML which is supposed to be the Graphic model database  from CATIA.
